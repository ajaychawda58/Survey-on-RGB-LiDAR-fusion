# Survey-on-RGB-LiDAR-fusion
A seminar survey on RGB LiDAR fusion.


In this paper, we study the existing sensor fusion methods for RGB and Lidar
data. Our goal is to categorize the methods into early, sequential, late and slow fusion, also
providing recent examples for better insight to our categories. In addition to that we compare
the methods based on empirical results and contributions to nd the best available technique.
